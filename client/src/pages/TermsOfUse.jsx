          <p>
            Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our

            expressly described in these Terms.

          <ul>
            <li>
              All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the SS2 name
              and the Swoosh design) are owned, registered and/or licensed by
              SS2. You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any
              trademarks, service marks, or trade names through your access or
              use of the Platform or Content.

              You agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from
              materials downloaded or printed from the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent SS2 approves the download or use of Content
              comprised of copyrights or copyrightable works, SS2 grants you a
              limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and
              revocable license to access and use such copyrights or
              copyrightable works solely for their intended purpose and solely
              for as long as SS2 makes such Content generally available to the
              public. You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content
              (including any trademarks or other intellectual property included
              in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal,
              non-commercial use. SS2 reserves the right to monitor your use and
              to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at

              any Content in violation of these terms or SS2’s intellectual
              property rights. SS2 allowing you this limited use does not
              constitute a waiver of any of SS2’s rights to the Content.{" "}
            </li>

            <li>
              Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by SS2 in

              translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create
              derivative works of, or in any way exploit any Content, including
              User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally
              post on the Platform), without SS2’s prior written consent.
              Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a breach of
              copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may
              subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.

          <li>POSTING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM</li>
          <p>
            User Content License. Some parts of the Platform allow you to post
            photos, videos, comments, and other content, which we refer to as
            “User Content.” SS2 is not responsible for User Content others post
            to the Platform. User Content is owned by you or whoever created it,
            but when you post User Content you license it to SS2 as described
            below:
          </p>

              Content, or any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User
              Content, for any purpose, including commercial use, which includes
              the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify, create
              derivative works, sublicense, distribute and assign these rights.
              SS2 may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any
              time. [See Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, and Philippines terms.]{" "}

            <li>
              You understand that deleted User Content may persist in SS2’s
              systems and on the Platform to the extent your User Content has
              been publicly posted or shared with others who have not deleted
              it, unless you or the relevant individual request deletion or
              blocking of personal data in accordance with applicable law.{" "}

            license to use all comments, feedback and ideas you may share with
            us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you, for any
            purposes whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing,
            manufacturing and marketing products and services and creating,
            modifying or improving products and services. [See Colombia and

          <p>
            We’re excited to have you contribute to the SS2 community. Here are
            a few basic rules:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Be Original. Only post User Content to the Platform if you have
              all permissions and rights needed to make that User Content
              available, including from any individuals who appear or are
              mentioned in your User Content.{" "}
            </li>

            <li>Be Safe.</li>

            <li>
              Do not do anything that may expose SS2 or its users to any type of
              harm, including anything that may disrupt, damage, disable, tamper
              with, overburden or limit the functionality of the Platform.
            </li>

            <li>
              Do not post User Content that contains software viruses, programs
              or other computer code, and do not circumvent or modify any
              Platform software or security technology.
            </li>

            <li>
              Do not use any data mining, robots, scraping or similar data
              gathering methods.
            </li>

            <li>
              Unless we indicate otherwise, our Platform is a public place. Do
              not post personal information to the Platform - yours or anybody
              else’s.
            </li>

            <li>Be Personal.</li>

            <li>
              Do not post any advertising, solicitation or commercial content on
              the Platform or accept payment from a third party in exchange for
              performing commercial activity on the Platform.
            </li>

            <li>
              Do not collect or solicit personal information from other Platform

            </li>

            <li>
              Be Appropriate. Respect the community and do not post User
              Content, link to a website, or do anything that is illegal,
              misleading, malicious, harassing, inaccurate, discriminatory, or
              otherwise objectionable or inappropriate or which violates any
              applicable laws. SS2 has the right to prescreen, monitor, or
              remove User Content – but we have no obligation to do so.
            </li>

            <li>
              Be Yourself. Do not impersonate any person or organization,
              including athletes or SS2 employees.

            and services (“Third Parties”). You may be able to connect with

            their activities, which are subject to separate terms of use and
            privacy policies. You should carefully review any Third Party’s

            <p>
              TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SS2 IS NOT

            <li>
              Be responsible and take precautions when interacting with other
              users (including users you do not know) on the Platform. Before

              bringing a friend, choosing public locations and letting someone
              know where you will be. SS2 is under no obligation to become
              involved with any user dispute, but may do so at its own
              discretion.

            LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Some jurisdictions do not permit certain

              SS2 may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any
              party at any time without notice to you, unless notice to you is

              or our obligations under these Terms.{" "}
            </li>

            <li>
              SS2’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of
              these Terms is not a waiver of any of these Terms or SS2’s rights.
              Users should always assume these Terms apply.
            </li>

            <li>
